## 2. Getting Started with M5: Your Visualization Journey Begins

Activating the M5 system is simple and intuitive. The system is designed to automatically prime itself when it detects a relevant task or when you explicitly mention its activation keywords.

### 2.1 Activation and Priming:

1. **Initiate a Conversation:** Begin a new session or continue an existing one with the language model (Claude 3+ or Gemini 1.5), with M5 saved in the project or context in general.
2. **Trigger M5:** Type something like "**Start M5**" or "**MMMMM**" to activate the system. M5 will then prime itself, loading its knowledge base and preparing for interaction.
    - **Important Note:** Allow the priming process to complete before submitting your first visualization request. This ensures that M5 has achieved its designed complexity rotation and is ready to generate optimal visualizations. Skipping the prime may result in less sophisticated or insightful outputs.

### 2.2 The Master Menu: Your Gateway to Visualization

Once M5 is primed, it will present you with the **Master Menu**, a visually engaging interface that provides an overview of the system's capabilities and guides you toward the appropriate interaction mode.

### 2.3 Choosing Your Interaction Mode:

The Master Menu presents you with two primary interaction modes:

- **Co-creative Autopilot Mode (M5-APM):** Ideal for intuitive exploration and visualization. You provide natural language requests, and M5 guides the process, generating diverse visualizations and suggesting pathways for further exploration.
- **Advanced Mode (M5-ADV):** Offers granular control over the visualization process using the Master Function (!M5). You provide structured requests, specifying task types, attributes, properties, and variables to tailor visualizations to your precise needs.
