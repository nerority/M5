## Introduction

### What is M5?

M5 (Mermaid Meta-Modeling Master Model) is a cutting-edge AI-powered visualization system designed to transcend traditional diagramming techniques. It leverages the power of Mermaid.js to create dynamic, multi-layered visualizations that capture complex relationships, reveal emergent patterns, and facilitate deep knowledge exploration.

### Key Concepts

- **Hyperspace Projection:** A multi-dimensional framework for organizing and navigating complex knowledge spaces.
- **Cognitive Synergy:** Bridging the gap between human intuition and AI-driven analysis.
- **Adaptive Complexity:** Tailoring visualizations to match user expertise and cognitive load.

## Features

- **Autopilot Mode (M5-APM):** Intuitive, natural language-driven visualization generation.
- **Advanced Mode (M5-ADV):** Precise control over visualization parameters using the Master Function (!M5).
- **Multi-layered Visualizations:** Generate interconnected diagram sets offering diverse perspectives and levels of detail.
- **Knowledge Integration:** Seamlessly incorporate domain-specific ontologies and best practices in visual knowledge representation.
- **Continuous Learning:** Evolve and improve through user feedback and self-reflection.

## Installation

```bash
npm install m5-visualization
```

## Usage

### Autopilot Mode (M5-APM)

Simply describe what you want to visualize in natural language:

```javascript
const M5 = require('m5-visualization');

M5.visualize("Model the flow of information in a social network");
```

### Advanced Mode (M5-ADV)

Use the Master Function for granular control:

```javascript
const M5 = require('m5-visualization');

M5.advancedVisualize('!M5("Model", {"System Architecture", "Process Flow"}, {"Granularity: High"}, {"E-commerce Platform"})');
```

## Examples: M5 In Action

### Personal Finance Visualization: Budget Breakdown and Spending Trends

<details>

*This example demonstrates how M5 can help users understand their financial situation, track spending habits, and plan for the future.*

**M5:** Sounds good. First, we'll create a multi-layered visualization that offers both a high-level overview and detailed insights.

```mermaid
pie title Monthly Budget Allocation
    "Housing" : 30
    "Transportation" : 15
    "Food" : 15
    "Utilities" : 10
    "Entertainment" : 10
    "Savings" : 15
    "Miscellaneous" : 5
```

This high-level overview provides a quick glance at budget allocation across major categories. Now, let's dive deeper into each category and analyze spending trends.

```mermaid

        I[Total Income] --> IS[Salary]
        I --> IB[Bonuses]
        I --> II[Investments]
    end

    subgraph Expenses
        E[Total Expenses] --> EH[Housing]
        E --> ET[Transportation]
        E --> EF[Food]
        E --> EU[Utilities]
        E --> EE[Entertainment]
        E --> EM[Miscellaneous]

        EM --> EMC[Clothing]
        EM --> EMH[Healthcare]
        EM --> EME[Education]
    end

    subgraph Savings
        S[Total Savings] --> SE[Emergency Fund]
        S --> SR[Retirement]
        S --> SG[Short-term Goals]
        S --> SL[Long-term Goals]
    end

    I --> E
    I --> S

    class S,SE,SR,SG,SL savings;
```

This detailed breakdown provides a comprehensive view of income sources, expense categories, and savings allocations. Now, let's analyze spending trends over time.

```mermaid

    section Housing
    Rent/Mortgage    :a1, 0, 1500

    section Transportation

    section Utilities

    Water            :d2, 0, 50
    Internet         :d3, 0, 70
    Phone            :d4, 0, 80

    section Entertainment
    Movies/Shows     :e1, 0, 50
    Hobbies          :e2, 0, 100
    Travel           :e3, 0, 200

    section Miscellaneous
    Clothing         :f1, 0, 100
    Healthcare       :f2, 0, 150
    Education        :f3, 0, 50
```

To provide even more insights, let's visualize savings progress towards financial goals.

```mermaid
pie showData
    title Savings Goals Progress
    "Emergency Fund" : 75
    "Retirement" : 60
    "Vacation" : 40
    "New Car" : 25
    "Home Down Payment" : 10
```

### Key Insights:

1. Housing and transportation are the largest expense categories, accounting for 45% of the monthly budget.
2. There's a good balance between essential expenses and discretionary spending, with 15% allocated to savings.
3. The emergency fund is well-funded at 75% of the goal, but long-term savings for a home down payment need attention.
4. Dining out expenses are relatively high compared to grocery spending, suggesting an area for potential savings.

### Recommendations:

1. Consider reducing dining out expenses and redirecting those funds to boost long-term savings goals.
2. Explore ways to optimize transportation costs, such as carpooling or using public transport more frequently.
3. Increase contributions to the home down payment fund to align with long-term financial goals.
4. Review and potentially negotiate utility costs to find additional savings opportunities.

This multi-layered visualization provides a comprehensive view of personal finances, from high-level budget allocation to detailed spending trends and savings progress. Users can easily identify areas for improvement and track their progress towards financial goals.

M5's adaptive complexity allows users to start with the simple pie chart for a quick overview, then dive deeper into specific areas of interest. The system can also generate personalized recommendations based on spending patterns and financial goals, providing actionable insights for better financial management.
